    "## Design Decisions for \"hospital\" table\n",
    "The table for \"hospital\" has the hospital id as its primary key, which is referenced by the \"weekly logs\" table and the \"hospital_quality\" table. All hospitals should have a name, so we restrict TEXT NOT NULL for \"hospital_name\". The \"emergency_services\" is a BOOLEAN because it indicates whether or not the hospital provided emergency services. Zipcode is a foreign key that references the \"locations\" table. All other attributes of the hospital -- \"address\", \"geocoded_hospital_address\", \"type_of_hospital\", and \"type_of_ownership\" -- are text-based and can have NULL values because it is information that may not be available but isn't crucial to have in order for the hospital to be included. Information such as the type of hospital, type of ownership, and emergency services are recorded here, despite being provided in the Hospital Quality data set. This is because we assume that these values are more or less fixed for a given hospital, and will not change very often (if at all)."

    "Each row in the \"weekly_logs\" table represents one hospital's activity for one week. It has a serial, autoincrementing column \"id\" as its primary key. It contains the hospital ID as a foreign key which references the 'Hospital\" table. This is so that each entry in this table can be linked to/associated with a hospital. It also contains a DATE column which represents the week for which a given entry is from, which we restrict to be NOT NULL, as otherwise a weekly log would be meaningless. This table also contains FLOAT8 columns that represent the number of beds available/in use for adult patients, pediatric care, and the ICU. All of these columns are floating point numeric columns as they are 7 day averages, so it is likely the values will not we integers. They are also constrained to be non-negative, as we can never have less than 0 beds available or less than 0 patients. We also constrain the number of beds in use to be less than or equal to the number of available beds for each category (adult, pediatric, and ICU), as we believe that logically the number of patients should not exceed the number of beds.

    "The table for \"locations\" is designed to store geographic information associated with hospitals. We use zipcode as the primary key to represent each ZIP code once within our database and avoid repeating city, state, and county information across multiple hospital records. While multiple hospitals can share the same ZIP code in practice, this design choice keeps our schema simple and still allows us to associate hospitals with their regional attributes efficiently. Storing state, city, and fips_code with each ZIP supports geographic analysis without duplicating location attributes in the \"hospital\" table. ZIP codes are stored as text to preserve leading zeros and match real-world postal formatting, and the table structure remains easy to join from the \"hospital\" table through the foreign key reference."
