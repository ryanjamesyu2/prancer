    "## Design Decisions for \"hospital\" table\n",
    "The table for \"hospital\" has the hospital id as its primary key, which is referenced by the \"weekly logs\" table and the \"hospital_quality\" table. All hospitals should have a name, so we restrict TEXT NOT NULL for \"hospital_name\". The \"emergency_services\" is a BOOLEAN because it indicates whether or not the hospital provided emergency services. Zipcode is a foreign key that references the \"locations\" table. All other attributes of the hospital -- \"address\", \"geocoded_hospital_address\", \"type_of_hospital\", and \"type_of_ownership\" -- are text-based and can have NULL values because it is information that may not be available but isn't crucial to have in order for the hospital to be included."
